# PROGRAMS
Euler's PHI Function

It's a program  written in C language to compute ∅(n), the value of Euler's phi function. It would compute ∅(n) by using a factorization of n into primes, not by finding all the a's between 1 and n that are relatively prime to n.
It is bit trickier than just finding the numbers between 1 and n that are relatively prime to n.
